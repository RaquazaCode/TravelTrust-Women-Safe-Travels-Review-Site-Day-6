# TravelTrust: A Verified Safety Platform for Solo Women Travelers

This repository contains the front-end explorations for **TravelTrust** (also known as Project Nightingale), a platform dedicated to empowering women to travel solo with confidence. Our mission is to alleviate the anxiety of solo travel by providing a trusted, data-driven resource for safety information, crowdsourced from a verified community of female travelers.

## The Problem

Solo female travel is a massive and rapidly growing market, with 84% of solo travelers being women. However, this growth is hindered by a significant and persistent friction point: personal safety. An estimated 70-88% of solo female travelers report feeling unsafe or worrying about their safety during trips.

Existing platforms like TripAdvisor and Booking.com are too generic, failing to capture nuanced, gender-specific safety concerns like harassment frequency, the safety of walking alone after dark, or whether a neighborhood's vibe changes at sunset. This forces women to piece together information from scattered Reddit threads and Facebook groups, often receiving advice from those who don't understand their unique context.

## The Solution: TravelTrust

TravelTrust aims to be the definitive, trusted data layer for women's travel safety. We bridge the gap between large, impersonal review sites and niche, unstructured community forums by providing:

* **Granular, Crowdsourced Safety Reviews:** Verified female travelers rate locations on specific metrics that matter, such as neighborhood safety (day/night), accommodation security, and transportation access.
* **Interactive Safety Maps:** We visualize this data on interactive maps, with color-coded "safe zones" (Green, Yellow, Red) to provide at-a-glance safety intelligence for destinations worldwide.
* **A Verified, Women-Only Community:** To ensure trust and authenticity, the platform is built around a "walled garden" concept, requiring user verification to foster a safe and supportive environment for sharing experiences.
* **Actionable, Empowering Content:** Beyond data, we provide "Safe Route" planning, "Verified Safe" venue badges, and a community hub to connect with fellow travelers, turning anxiety into confident adventure.
