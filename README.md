TravelTrust-Women-Safe-Travels-Review-Site-Day-6
This repository holds the codebase for the TravelTrust Women's Safe Travels Review Site, a platform designed to help women travel more safely and confidently. The project, named "Nightingale", is a solo female travel safety platform where users can discover safe venues, connect with verified female travelers, and share their experiences to help other women explore the world securely.

This repository contains three different implementations of the front-end, each built with a different no-code/low-code tool:

Lovable: A front-end built using the Lovable platform.

Builder.io-no-code-one-shot-build: A front-end built using Builder.io.

VO-no-code-one-shot-build: A front-end built using V0.
